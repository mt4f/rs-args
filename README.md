# Readme ( rs-args )
`rs-args` is a rust crate which enables developers to easily create
command-line-interfaces using just rust. It enables command argument
parsing by using the tools of a full-blown programming language. It is
also actively being maintained as part of my "suite" of tools which
makes my, and hopefully your, life as a software developer much easier.

I am aware that there are probably much simpler solutions to this
problem, but I decided to approach this my own way. 

## Implementation
Currently, this isn't nearly done, so thre is no way of actually using
this ( completely ), however you can make use of the lexical analysis
if you want, although that isn't the main purpose of this crate, so I
wouldn't recommend it.

## Contact
If you have suggestions or complaints, feel free to open an issue or
create a pull request, and I'll look into it.
